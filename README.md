# virtual-pet


Digital pet game where you can name and care for your dragon.

User is able to feed the dragon, give water to the dragon, and allow the dragon to release it's flames.

When the user choses to take care of the dragon at one level, other levels may be effected.  For example, feeding the dragon will reduce hunger levels, but increase the amount of flame building inside of the dragon.  If you chose to release the flames, the dragon becomes less thirsty, but also more hungry.  Levels that can be changed are:
* Hunger Level
* Thirst Level
* Fire Level

The dragon may die when any level reaches 100 and levels cannot go below 0.

Each time the user interacts by selecting a menu option, the tick effect will add to each level (except chosing to end the game).  After a certain level is reached, the amount of tick effect becomes random.

The game is set to run in a loop until the user kills the pet or decides to end the game by menu prompt.
