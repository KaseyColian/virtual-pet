# virtual-pet


Digital pet game where you can name and care for your dragon.

User is able to feed the dragon, give water to the dragon, and allow the dragon to release it's flames.

When the user choses to take care of the dragon at one level, other levels may be effected.  Feeding the dragon will reduce hunger levels, but increase the amount of flame building inside of the dragon.  If you chose to release the flames, the dragon becomes less thirsty, but also more hungry.
